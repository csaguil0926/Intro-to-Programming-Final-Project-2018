# Intro to Programming Final Project - Fall 2018

I created a game called Gacha Game. The word gacha comes from Japan and it is a capsule toy mechanic. Gacha games stem from this idea and as someone collects capsule toys in real life, a user in the game would collect players. The user will then use these players to compete in battles and win the game. My game is based in Korea. The plot consists of kpop idols who want to rest but their companies want them to work. The user will have to summon idols and beat opponents, such as fans and companies, to win the idols' rest.
